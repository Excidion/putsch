A **putsch** (from german *Putsch* [*/pʊtʃ/*](https://lex-audio.useremarkable.com/mp3/putsch_gb_1.mp3)) is, according to the [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition/putsch):

> A violent attempt to overthrow a government; a coup.

This repository contains a Python implementation of a similarly titled card game.
I created it to learn about object oriented programming.
When running `python game.py` a round of 4 virtual Players will be played, making decisions at random (for now).

### Future Plans
+ Interact with some sort of UI, to enable real humans to play the game. (Ideas for UI include a Telegram Chatbot, pygame, tkinter, ...)
+ AI class whose decisions are not just random.
+ Move logging to decorators for cleaner code (and to learn about decorators).
